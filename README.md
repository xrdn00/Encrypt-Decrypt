## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Tutorial

### Installing Jupyter to work with the GUI in this repo
- 1) on windows, download the `exe` file (jupyter notebook) trough anaconda, and just install anaconda, then simply install the 'package' jupyter(and/or jupyter-notebook) (I think jupyter notebook should be included when installing anaconda by default, or at least, jupyter)
- 2) on windows, install `pip` by installing `Python3` from the Python website. Can be tricky sometimes to find the executable of python3, and windows loves to "redirect you to the MS store", be careful here.

- 1) on linux  `apt install jupyter-notebook  pip`
- 2) on linux `pip install cryptography`

You *might* need to (on both os) do `pip install  ipywidgets` or Likewise, but, I think it should not even be required.
